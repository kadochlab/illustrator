# Learning materials for Adobe Illustrator

1. Guide: A great [Adobe Illustrator guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TXmbltzBPcApCcuJ9HLOIQgWPqKylrFRWRudrN-5vBE/edit#) has been created by the [Raj lab at U. Penn.](https://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu/)! Here is a [blog post](https://rajlaboratory.blogspot.com/2019/08/i-adobe-illustrator-for-scientific.html) with some background, including some additional linked blog posts that I also recommend reading. This covers many of the basic tools and use cases in Illustrator and is tailored towards scientific figures.
