# Learning materials for Adobe Illustrator

1. **Guide**: A great [Adobe Illustrator guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TXmbltzBPcApCcuJ9HLOIQgWPqKylrFRWRudrN-5vBE/edit#) has been created by the [Raj lab at U. Penn.](https://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu/)! Here is a [blog post](https://rajlaboratory.blogspot.com/2019/08/i-adobe-illustrator-for-scientific.html) with some background, including some additional linked blog posts that I also recommend reading (especially [this one](https://rajlaboratory.blogspot.com/2016/02/from-reproducibility-to-over.html)). This covers many of the basic tools and use cases in Illustrator and is tailored towards scientific figures.

2. **Art / Icon Sources**: There are several options for free art, icons, etc. that may be useful for creating figures.

- [Biorender](https://www.biorender.com/): Very popular and extensive library. Required license (i.e., not open-source), which is currently share as a lab - inquire with Kristen about the login credentials. More licenses are available from HMS - does not appear to be free (see [https://it.hms.harvard.edu/service/biorender](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/service/biorender)).
- [NIH BioArt Source](https://bioart.niaid.nih.gov/): Open-source repository of 2000+ science and medical art visuals from NIAID.
- [bioicons](https://bioicons.com/): A large, open-source library of bio-themed art and icons.
- [SciDraw](https://scidraw.io/): A free repository of drawings.
- [Phylopic](https://www.phylopic.org/): A large, open source library of silhouette images for various forms of life.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&o=r): A huge icon library that includes some free, open-source options. Better for non-biological icons, like generic computer icons. 
- [Reactome Icon Library](https://reactome.org/icon-lib): Reactome has made a large, open-source library of cell/molecular biology icons freely available.
- [Emojis](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html): Emojis can be useful for certain purposes and there are a ton of options that have been standardized as a form of font by Unicode. They also offer a range of skin tones (for human emojis) and can help ensure everyone feels welcome.

3. **Basic Document Setup Information**: Here is some basic information about how you should be setting up your documents for optimal use.

- Page Size: Letter (8.5 x 11 inches or 612 x 792 pixels/pts for portrait; inverse for landscape)
- Color Mode: RGB (suggested default; more flexible; best for digital viewing) or CMYK (less flexible; best for printing)
- Raster Effects: High (300 ppi)

4. **Example Plots**: This repository contains several example plots that are popular in the lab to help with learning Illustrator
